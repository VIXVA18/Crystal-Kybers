# Crystal-Kybers
About the Project :
This project implements a simple encryption and decryption mechanism using the XOR operation. It generates a random public and secret key, encrypts a message using a nonce, and decrypts it back to verify correctness.

Prerequisites :
  1) Python

Required Libraries :
  1) import os
  2) import random

Important Notes about the project : 
  1) The current implementation does not use asymmetric encryption despite generating a public and secret key.
  3) The same key and nonce must be used to decrypt successfully.
